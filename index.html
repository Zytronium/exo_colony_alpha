    <h2><strong>About the Colony</strong></h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Exo Colony Alpha</strong> is humanity's first interstellar
        settlement. Located in the <strong>Alpha Centauri system</strong>, this
        colony represents a bold step forward in<em>exploration</em>, <em>innovation</em>,
        and survival beyond Earth. The first interstellar colony ships are
        planned to launch by late <strong>2035</strong>, and you can be on one of
        them! Equipped with microscopic cameras, tiny interstellar probes
        propelled by next-generation solar sails have been sent to Alpha
        Centauri's <strong>Proxima B</strong>, the first planet orbiting
        <strong>Proxima Centauri</strong>, one of the three stars in the Alpha
        Centauri system. These probes have taken photos of the planet and its
        landscape, which have been colorized and enhanced. One of them
        is displayed above.
    </p>

    <p>
        Take on the challenge of surviving and thriving at <strong>Exo Colony
        Alpha</strong> under three suns painting an ever-shifting sky of
        <span class="gradient-text">red and gold</span>! Help the colony
        overcome the many challenges to come. Harsh radiation, unpredictable
        weather patterns, and other unforeseen challenges will test the limits
        of human ingenuity. However, together, we will overcome, bringing about
        a better future for the descendants of the colony and the rest of
        humanity as a whole.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is more than survival. It is the beginning of a <strong>new
        era</strong>. With cutting-edge technology, terraforming research, and
        the indomitable human spirit, we will transform Proxima b into a home
        for future generations. Join the <u>pioneers</u>, shape the destiny of
        the colony, and ensure that humanity thrives among the stars!
